Characters to be deleted are not required to go successively, there can be any gaps between them. For example, for the string \"abaca\" the following strings are subsequences: \"abaca\", \"aba\", \"aaa\", \"a\" and \"\" (empty string). But the following strings are not subsequences: \"aabaca\", \"cb\" and \"bcaa\".\n\nYou are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIn one move you can take any subsequence $t$ of the given string and add it to the set $S$. The set $S$ can't contain duplicates.

The left bank of the river is cell $0$ and the right bank is cell $n + 1$ (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of $n + 2$ cells numbered from $0$ to $n + 1$). There are also $m$ wooden platforms on a river, the $i$-th platform has length $c_i$ (so the $i$-th platform takes $c_i$ consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed $n$.\n\nYou are standing at $0$ and want to reach $n+1$ somehow. If you are standing at the position $x$, you can jump to any position in the range $[x + 1; x + d]$. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.\n\nYou want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line.

Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$.

As a result, he got some new string $t$.

Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).\n\nSurely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least).

The President plans to choose a set of $n-1$ roads such that:\n\n  it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the $n-1$ chosen roads,  if $d_i$ is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city $i$, moving only along the $n-1$ chosen roads, then $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_n$ is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). \n\nIn other words, the set of $n-1$ roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city $1$ to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the $n-1$ chosen roads).\n\nThe president instructed the ministry to prepare $k$ possible options to choose $n-1$ roads so that both conditions above are met.\n\nWrite a program that will find $k$ possible ways to choose roads for repair.

All students that are chosen leave the row and join the first team. Secondly, the second coach will make the same move (but all students chosen by him join the second team). Then again the first coach will make such move, and so on. This repeats until the row becomes empty (i. e. the process ends when each student becomes to some team).\n\nYour problem is to determine which students will be taken into the first team and which students will be taken into the second team.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of students and the value determining the range of chosen students during each move, respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$), where $a_i$ is the programming skill of the $i$-th student. It is guaranteed that all programming skills are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a string of $n$ characters; $i$-th character should be 1 if $i$-th student joins the first team, or 2 otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n2 4 5 3 1\n\nOutput\n11111\n\nInput\n5 1\n2 1 3 5 4\n\nOutput\n22111\n\nInput\n7 1\n7 2 1 3 5 4 6\n\nOutput\n1121122\n\nInput\n5 1\n2 4 5 3 1\n\nOutput\n21112\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the first coach chooses the student on a position $3$, and the row becomes empty (all students join the first team).\n\nIn the second example the first coach chooses the student on position $4$, and the row becomes $[2, 1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 4, 5]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes empty (and students with programming skills $[1, 2]$ join the second team).\n\nIn the third example the first coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes $[1, 3, 5, 4, 6]$ (students with programming skills $[2, 7]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $5$, and the row becomes $[1, 3, 5]$ (students with programming skills $[4, 6]$ join the second team). Then the first coach chooses the student on position $3$, and the row becomes $[1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 5]$ join the first team). And then the second coach chooses the remaining student (and the student with programming skill $1$ joins the second team).\n\nIn the fourth example the first coach chooses the student on position $3$, and the row becomes $[2, 1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 4, 5]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes empty (and students with programming skills $[1, 2]$ join the second team)."
